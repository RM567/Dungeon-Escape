# Dungeon Escape


A group project, with 5 people involved, where we were tasked on creating a vertical slice of a game based on the theme of 'Escape'. Dungeon Escape is an isometric game that is based on death, once the player dies they will respawn with a power-up. 

I was the main programmer for this game and was tasked with creating a lot of the mechanics of the game. I coded the character movement, combat and animations, the enemy AI, dealing and taking damage, a point system that allows the character to pass through levels as they reach a certain threshold, the in-game UI and the power-ups. This was all done with Unreal Engine's blueprints system. 



P.S: The reason this is only a README file without the code is because the entire project is 7GB and you can only upload 1GB to github.
