# Dungeon Escape
A group project, with 5 people involved, where we were tasked on creating a vertical slice of a game based on the theme of 'Escape'. Dungeon Escape is an isometric game that is based on death, once the player dies they will respawn with a power-up. 

I was the main programmer for this game and was tasked with creating a lot of the mechanics of the game.
